By comparing each edit distance,
I find the edit distance of mouse and human is the smallest,
which means that the protein sequence of mouse and human is relatively similar. 
It is no suprise that the edit distance of mouse and random is very close to human and random's.

Through the scores and BLAST-like visual alignment based of blossum62,
we have a clearer understanding of the similarity of human and mouse.
The score of mouse and random is equal to human and random's, they are all below 0 (-250).
On the other hand, the score of human and mouse is 1091, which is a very large positive number.
Furthermore, the BLAST-like visual alignment of human and mouse gives a very intuitive explanation.
All of these suggest that there is a strong similarity between human and mouse's protein sequence.

Compared to edit distance, scores and BLAST-like visual alighment is more concise and intuition.
