I found these tasks were very difficuilt at first, but at last I found it very interesting. 
It took me a long time to achieve all these tasks and I gained great satisfaction.
Although I still do not have a good command of girkraken and github, I think I have already got a general idea of them. 
Thanks for the help from teachers and my friends. 
Additionally, I hope professors can explain "merge conflict" in more detail.
